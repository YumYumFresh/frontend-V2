          Eating local food while it’s in season is more than just a cool fad
          for hip youths and hippies alike. It’s a way of life and a necessity
          to help lead us into creating a sustainable future, for us and for
          generations to come. Yum Yum Fresh is your go-to site to know not only
          know what produce is currently in season, but also your resource to
          find local farmers markets in your area.
          <hr />
          Eating seasonally and supporting local farmers not only tastes better,
          but it puts resources back into your community, creating an eco-system
          of growth, sustainability, and opportunity.
